# Procedural-Roguelike

Inspired by **Procedural Content Generation for Unity Game Development** by Ryan Watkins. After skimming through his example, I created my own version entirely from scratch.

## How to Play
#### Warning: do not play in fullscreen. The option to exit the game from within a menu is not yet supported.

#### Controls
`Move - WASD`

`Attack - J or Left-Click`

### Objective
Survive!! Explore the caves to find loot beyond your wildest dreams, but watch out for the denizens lurking within.

### Caves
To enter a cave you must find a passage tile and step onto it. After a short journey you will find yourself in a cave on the otherside. Uh-oh! Did you hear that!! It looks like the passage collapsed behind you! Your only way out now is to search the cave for a passage to the surface.
